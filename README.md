# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process that determines whether analysed data is positive, negative or neutral.

A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase.
For data analysts, this helps enterprises or individuals conduct market researches, take surveys in various categories, after identifying, extracting and quantifying data throught third party sentiment analysis APIs. These researches and observations help in achieving useful insights in all fields.

# TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
In the projects that you will find here, I have performed a sentiment analysis on the tweets that will be extracted after giving it a suitable topic of interest or a query. 
The tweets are analysed and their polarity is measured differentiating them as positive, negative and neutral tweets with respect to the query.

The two appraches at the twitter sentiment analysis-
1. Using simple automation APIs like Tweepy, that is easy to use and helps access the twitter API. With Tweepy, the accuracy of the sentiment in the tweets is not the best as it is a pre-defined library that has the key phrases and adjectives pre programmed into it. While it can identify the major words present in a sentence while categorising tweets, some tweets that seem ambiguous can be placed in the wrong category due to human language and slang variations.
2. As sentiment analysis originally combines Natural Language processing with its other techniques, using the NLTK(Natural Language ToolKit) to perform test analysis provides less scope of the previously mentioned ambiguity. NLTK uses many modules along with the NaiveBayesClassifier that works on the Bayes Probability to work on datasets to perform the segregation of sentiments. Although NLTK in itself is a big package, combining simple APIs with the tools of NLTK provides better accuracy.

# API
Application Package Interface. Instead of writting millions of code we can use simply the api and get information about it. There are number of projects you could do with API in a simple and effiecient way. For example :- Price Comparison , Password Checker etc. 
You can check out an efficient way to use API to check password safely ![Password Checker](https://github.com/sauravchaudharysc/Password-Checker)
